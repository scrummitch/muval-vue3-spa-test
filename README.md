# Muval Vue 3 SPA Test

This is a clean Vue 3 project ready for you to set up a basic single-page
application (SPA) to consume the API you built in the Laravel backend test.

This test requires you to have already completed the Laravel backend test:
<https://github.com/muval-apps/backend-test>

## Getting started

1. Download or clone this repos.
2. Install the base packages. You can install additional packages to assist.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Compile and hot-reload for development:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The app will now be accessible via your browser and update when you make
changes to the code.

## Project user requirements

The application you are building is a basic task management system with the
following:

* Task Management: Create, view, and edit tasks.
* User Assignment: Each task is associated with a user.

## Evaluation criteria

You will be evaluated on:

1. **Quality of build**
    * Is the build following Vue 3 conventions?
    * Is state management with Pinia being utilised?
    * Have the project user requirements been met?
2. **API integration**
    * Did you integrate the API endpoints?
    * Is authentication set up to allow user authentication and prevent
    exposure of secure data?
3. **Code readability**
    * Is the code clean and easy to understand?
    * Has linting/formatting been run?
4. **Aesthetic**
    * Is the layout reasonably clean?
    * Are Tailwind utility classes applied to style your interfaces?
    * Is the application intuitive to use without requiring in-depth
    instructions?

## Submitting your test

Once you have completed your build of the project user requirements, with
consideration of the evaluation criteria, save a zip of your revised code.
